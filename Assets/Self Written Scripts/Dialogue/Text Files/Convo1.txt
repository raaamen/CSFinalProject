$Police Captain
Officer Jackson come in. How are things at the station?
$You
Calm for now, sir. I haven’t seen anything concerning on the cameras.
$Police Captain
You remember how to operate them, right Jackson?
$You
Er… it’s been a while sir. I could use a refresher.
$Police Captain
Alright Jackson. Pay close attention.
If you’re using a keyboard, use WASD to move the camera around.
Use Q and E to zoom in and out.
If you’re using a gamepad, use the right joystick to move the camera around.
Use the left joystick to zoom in and out.
Easy enough for you?
$You
Yep, I got it. Thank you, sir.
$Police Captain
Stay safe tonight, Jackson. I don’t believe in any of that paranormal stuff, but things have definitely been weird around here.
Keep your wits, and be careful. If you see or hear anything strange, investigate carefully, at your own risk.
We can’t afford to do any replacing right now, haha!
Alright, have a good night Jackson. If you call, I’ll try and answer.
$You
Thank you, sir. I’ll try my best. Good night.

You’re now alone.
Time to get to work.
Use the cameras like the captain said. Keep an eye on things. Our shift ends in the morning.
…
I really hope tonight is peaceful.
